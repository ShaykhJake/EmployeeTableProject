## Copyright Notes

All icons are supplied by FontAwesome, except for the "IBM" logo at the top left which was snatched from IBM.com and the IBM "eye-bee-m" honeybee favico, also snatched from IBM.

## Summary

This project was created in response to an IBM coding challenge for a CRUD-capable employee table, utiling Node as a backend.

## Ideal Outcomes

Ideally this would be written with TypeScript and appropriately compiled for deployment. For the sake of this exercise, everything was kept as vanilla JavaScript to avoid any package conflicts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from github
2. Install BackEnd dependencies: from the BackEnd directory, "npm install"
3. Run the server from within the BackEnd directory: "node app.js"
4. Load the employee_table.html from the FrontEnd directory into a brower
